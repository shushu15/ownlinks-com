The complex of chess games presented in the <strong>RIFAT club</strong> is intended primarily for
children who already know how to move pieces, and their parents.
</p><p>
Games develop attention, an understanding of the comparative value and strength of
pieces, and emphasize the importance of advancing pawns . 5-10-minute duels with a
small number of pieces and simple, clear rules will give players pleasure, help them get
used to the world of chess. Many adults will also be pleasantly surprised by some of the
difficulties in such seemingly simple games. The program provides: <strong>FOUR LEVELS</strong> of
the player, the ability to play for <strong>ANY SIDE</strong>, a game of <strong>TWO</strong> against each other, the
function of <strong>RETURNING THE TURN</strong>. These games will allow novice chess players to
quickly master the comparison of the strength of pieces, the values of connected and
missed pawns, the diagonal capabilities of bishops, etc.and acquire primary chess skills
- such as attacking pieces, safe and mutual attacks , basic ways to protect pieces,
double strikes.

Having mastered the moves of the pieces and learned what checkmate is, novice chess
players tend to play <strong>REAL CHESS</strong>. However, to keep all 32 chess pieces in the field of
your attention is an impossible task for a child. In addition, children can not keep their
attention on the game for a long time, which is necessary for the successful completion
of a chess game. Their knowledge and skills do not allow them to bring the game to its
logical end. That is why the game in their performance turns into a meaningless
exchange of moves and random exchange of pieces. Such games quickly become
boring and end in vain ( that is, they do not end at all) and, in fact, turn children away
from chess, often forever. All these features of novice chess players are taken into
account in the proposed games â€“ short, clear, effective and with a small number of
pieces.

<strong>THE UNIQUENESS</strong> of the presented games lies primarily in the fact that players are
offered <strong>a real CHESS BATTLE</strong> according to the chess rules! However, what is
important, the goal of this single combat is not checkmate (often an abstract, random
and incomprehensible concept for beginners), but much more accessible goals for their
understanding - <strong>THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION</strong> of the enemy or the
<strong>TRANSFORMATION</strong> of a pawn into a queen. The <strong>SECOND FEATURE</strong> is that after
getting acquainted with the rules, users can easily play the proposed games live, <strong>ON a
REAL BOARD</strong>, without gadgets and monitors, using the program only for getting
acquainted with the rules and for training. In this case, you can easily choose the
appropriate handicap for each child by adjusting the quantitative composition of the
chess pieces. <strong>THE THIRD FEATURE</strong> is that with the handicap, children will <strong>REALLY</strong> be
able to beat adult players, so dads will not be bored!
